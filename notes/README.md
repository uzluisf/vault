# Notes

## Structure

There's a directory, named after the topic, for each topic, and each topic has a
single Markdown `README.md` file where all the textual content ought to be
stored. There can also be an `asset` directory where `images`, `code`, etc. the
`README.md` file references.

For example:

```
├── asynchronous-programming-in-js
│   ├── assets
│   └── README.md
└── theory-of-computation
    ├── assets
    │   └── images
    └── README.md
```

## Titles (in alphabetical order)

* [Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript](./asynchronous-programming-in-js/README.md)
* [Theory of Computation](./theory-of-computation/README.md)
